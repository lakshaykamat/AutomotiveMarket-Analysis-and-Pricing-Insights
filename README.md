# AutoDeals: Used Cars Analysis
## Project Background

The used car market is rapidly expanding, with buyers and sellers relying on data to make informed decisions. This project aims to analyze a dataset of used cars to uncover insights, trends, and patterns that can benefit potential buyers, sellers, and dealerships. By leveraging data analytics techniques, we strive to identify key factors affecting car prices, fuel efficiency, and overall performance.


## Access to Resources
- **Dataset:** A dataset of used cars, including attributes like price, mileage, engine size, power, and more.
- **Python:** Jupyter Notebook for coding and visualizing analysis
- **Excel:** For quick data exploration and validation
- **Tableau:** For Dashboard

All necessary resources are included in the repository to reproduce the analysis.


## Data Overview
The dataset contains information about used cars, including but not limited to:

- Features:
  - Price: The selling price of the car
  - Mileage (kmpl and km/kg): Fuel efficiency in kilometers per liter (petrol/diesel) or kilometers per kilogram (CNG/LPG)
  - Engine Size (CC): Engine capacity in cubic centimeters
  - Power (BHP): Horsepower output of the car
  - Car Age: Derived from the year of manufacture
  - Kilometers Driven: Total distance the car has been driven
  - Fuel Type: Type of fuel used (Petrol, Diesel, CNG, etc.)
  - Transmission: Type of transmission (Manual or Automatic)
  - Seats: Number of seats available in the car
  - Size: Over 6,019 rows with complete and incomplete data for analysis.

The dataset has been preprocessed to handle missing values, identify outliers, and engineer features for better insights. Key tasks include:

- Handling missing values in mileage, engine size, and power columns.
- Normalizing mileage to accommodate different units (kmpl vs. km/kg).
- Analyzing relationships between features like price, mileage, engine size, and power.

## Executive Summary


## Insigts Deep Dive
